Feel free to edit or delete this content.<\/p>\\n\\n<p>The Help Center is designed to provide a complete self-service support option for your customers. The Help Center is made up of two parts: a knowledge base and a community. Your customers can search for knowledge base articles to learn a task or search the community and ask fellow users questions. If your customers can't find an answer, they can submit a support request.<\/p>\\n\\n<p>For more information, see <a href=\"https:\/\/support.zendesk.com\/hc\/en-us\/articles\/203664386\">Help Center guide for end users<\/a>.<\/p><p>Each user in your community has a Help Center profile (Guide Professional only), so your community members can get to know one another better. Profiles contain relevant information about the community member, along with their activities and contributions to the community. Profiles also give each community member the option to follow another user and get notifications when that user makes a post or comment.<\/p>",
